# Postmortem: The Great Authentication Outage

🌩️ Issue Summary
Duration: From 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM (UTC-07:00)
Impact: The user authentication service went on an unexpected vacation, leaving 30% of our users stranded at the login gate.
Root Cause: Turns out, the authentication server decided to take a siesta due to a misconfigured firewall rule. It thought it was a beach day.

🕰️ Timeline
9:45 AM: Our monitoring alerts woke up from their coffee break and screamed, “Houston, we have a problem!” Successful logins dropped like a mic at a rap battle.
9:50 AM: Engineers raised their eyebrows (and their coffee mugs) as authentication latency spiked. They suspected the server might be moonlighting as a sloth.
10:00 AM: Investigation mode activated! We checked the database logs, analyzed query performance, and even offered the server a motivational speech.
11:30 AM: Escalated the incident to the DevOps team. They put on their detective hats and started questioning the load balancer, who remained suspiciously silent.
12:00 PM: Misleading path: We interrogated the load balancer settings, but it just shrugged and said, “I’m just here for the memes.”
1:00 PM: Eureka moment! The firewall rules had a secret rendezvous last night and decided to block incoming traffic to the authentication server.
1:30 PM: We rolled back the firewall changes faster than a cat chasing a laser pointer.
2:00 PM: Service restored! Users rejoiced, and the authentication server promised to attend firewall rule therapy sessions.
🚒 Root Cause and Resolution
Cause: The firewall rule got a little too trigger-happy and blocked our users like a bouncer at an exclusive club.
Resolution: We whispered sweet nothings to the firewall, promising it a vacation to the cloud if it behaved. Then we reverted the rule like a plot twist in a telenovela.

🚀 Corrective and Preventative Measures
Automated Testing: Taught the firewall some manners with automated tests for rule changes. It’s now less “block party” and more “open house.”
Monitoring Upgrades:
Set up alerts for sudden traffic drops. No more surprises!
Monitored firewall rule changes like a hawk watching over its nest.
Documentation Love Letters:
Clearly documented firewall rules and their purpose. Added emojis for flair.
Included rollback procedures with a side of confetti.
Incident Response Dance Lessons:
Trained engineers in salsa (systematic analysis, laughter, swift correction, and apologies).
Practiced cross-team cha-cha during incidents.

🎁 Takeaway
Remember, even servers have their off days. Treat your infrastructure with kindness, and it’ll reward you with uptime and maybe a virtual high-five. Stay secure, stay curious, and keep those firewalls in check!
