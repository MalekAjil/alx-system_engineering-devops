# How To Install and Use Docker on Ubuntu 20.04

#First, update your existing list of packages:
sudo apt update

#Next, install a few prerequisite packages which let apt use packages over HTTPS:
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

#Then add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

#Add the Docker repository to APT sources:
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"

#This will also update our package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo.
#Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu repo:
apt-cache policy docker-ce

#Finally, install Docker:
sudo apt install docker-ce
#Docker should now be installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot.
sudo systemctl status docker
